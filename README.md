## KNOWN BUGS:
* Under macOS printing using print() crashes the program when running from the bash script
need to fix the bash script probably, removed prints for now.


## Ideas for further versions:
* Add exception (Single type)

* Add a drop down menu to allow user to choose a category for his session
* make an executable file for the project
* Make moving the window easier (not require right click)
* always on top toggle
* Abort session (a button when clicked discards the last part of the session, from start or from last pause)
* Add an option to cancel current session (button) (duplicate?)
* Show time since last session
* Running / Not running color indication
* Add an indicator of the current status (duplicate?)
* smart login - user can put username and continue. you can give a password, but don't have to
* Upon pausing a session - rename Start button to Resume (merge the two buttons)
* Add an option to create new categories
* Allow continuing from a closed running or paused session
* When resetting, verify with user (confirmation window)
* Check option to name change to Time Chamber after the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in DBZ

## Postponed ideas:
* Render irrelevant buttons un-clickable when relevant
